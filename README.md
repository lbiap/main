# Special Thanks

Joe Collentine [for a great workshop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSOaWoKzdbw) and [portions of the code for iterating through corpora and generating data from them](https://github.com/jcollentine/LAEL-python-workshop). (We recommend checking out the previous links if you'd like a singularly well-done introduction to using Python and collecting data from text files.)  

Ye Lin Park for fantastic help on the bundle database.  

Ashleigh Cox & Ahmed Abdelrazek for testing the program on Windows  

[Burak Senel](https://twitter.com/buraksenel) for making LBiaP Pandas 2.x compatible.
